# Shortest Path Maze with Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project implements a maze visualization tool where users can customize a maze,set start and end points, and find the shortest path between them using Dijkstra's algorithm. Users can also add walls to the maze to create obstacles.

## Features

- Set start and end points
- Add walls to the maze
- Find the shortest path between start and end points using Dijkstra's algorithm
- Reset the maze to its initial state

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/shortest-path-maze.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

3. Use the buttons provided to interact with the maze:
   - Set Start Point: Click to set the start point in the maze.
   - Set End Point: Click to set the end point in the maze.
   - Set Wall: Click and drag to create walls in the maze.
   - Run Dijkstra: Click to find the shortest path between the start and end points.
   - Reset Maze: Click to reset the maze to its initial state.
